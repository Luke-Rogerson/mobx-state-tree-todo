# RNTSMobXTodo

## What is it?

A todo app built with React Native, TypeScript, [MobX-state-tree](https://mobx-state-tree.js.org/intro/getting-started) for state management and [UI Kitten](https://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten/) for styling.

## Features

-   Add, edit and remove todos.
-   Set due dates
-   Mark as completed
-   Persisted todos

## Getting started

Make sure you have [React Native set up](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
To start the app: `yarn start`, followed by `yarn ios`.  
To run tests: `yarn test`

## Thoughts

I've been wanting an excuse to try MobX. It's a very different paradigm to what I'm used to with things like Redux or Apollo Client, and it felt wrong to be ["mutating" state directly](https://mobx-state-tree.js.org/intro/getting-started#snapshots-are-awesome), but once I got over some intial config pain, it was lovely and straightforward to work with! I will certainly use it again in the future.

UI Kitten is a styling framework I've been eying for a while, so it was also fun to give it a spin!
